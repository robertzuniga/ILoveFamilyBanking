# I Love Family Banking

## Financial Intelligence

Everyone uses money to conduct life activities...

but few people realize the value of using personal banking strategies in day-to-day transactions.

Family Banking rest upon three inter-related concepts

1. Think Long Term
2. Understand the value of interest and time
3. Don't be afraid to capitalize

## Personal Banking as a Personal Business

In general, the path to financial independence is comprised of two activities: the creation of wealth and the maintenance of wealth.

There is no shortage of books, seminars and opportunities to create wealth through formal employment, stock markets, real estate and  business ownership. These activities are considered to be offensive strategies to wealth creation.

There is, however, much confusion that results in limited understanding by most on the foundation of wealth creation ... it's maintenance. The activities here can best be described as defensive strategies to wealth creation.

The focus of the I Love Family Banking App is to provide easy to use tools that assist in both offensive and defensive strategies to wealth creation.  This user friendly tool is design to be robust: from the user experience as well as for the web developer.
